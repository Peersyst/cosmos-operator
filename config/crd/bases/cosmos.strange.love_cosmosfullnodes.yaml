                                        if a non-empty volume is desired. This may
                                        be any local object from a non-empty API group
                                        (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim
                                        object. When this field is specified, volume
                                        binding will only succeed if the type of the
                                        specified object matches some installed volume
                                        populator or dynamic provisioner. This field
                                        will replace the functionality of the DataSource
                                        field and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                                        they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, both fields (DataSource and
                                        DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                        automatically if one of them is empty and
                                        the other is non-empty. There are two important
                                        differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                        * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                        types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any
                                        non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                        objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                        values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                        all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                        value is specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                        requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                        to be enabled.'
